November 11, 2013:  Collaborators on Camera-based Gravity game control mechanic:  James Potts Vlad Klimkiv Lance Regala Michael Quirch  This is the most interesting of a number of player control ideas our team came upon while seeking to create a brainstormed game design called "clayman" where a clay player character would have to change into various shapes and elements such as a sphere or a box and elements like a steel man or ice man in order to progress through a series of puzzle encounters.  The primary interesting concept for our puzzle was to either rotate the world or the player character in order to utilize the walls for traversal upon rotation with the accelerometer or using a swipe. Our game idea when looking to achieve a quick prototype within the 30 hour time frame quickly boiled down to a tutorial level where the player only existed in sphere form.  As we began to experiment with Havok's physics systems in searching for various controls we developed several interesting control schemes that were velocity-based and also serveral iterations of controls that were "force-based" using Havok physics. Removing the world gravity and basing the downward force upon the orientation of the camera was a very interesting concept that we stumbled upon with the help of Joel Van Eenwyk from the Project Anarchy team.  Much thanks to the Project Anarchy dev team for their support and scripting expertise for helping us discover this fun and interesting mechanic within vForge.
